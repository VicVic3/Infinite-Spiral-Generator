  Welcome to my program to create infinite spirals and weird geometries.
  There are three files which basically make the same; an excel (.xlsm), an python file (.py) and an executable (.exe)
  
  - The Exel file:    ISG v1.0 in Excel with macros.xlsm
      By default, Windows blocks the use of macros because is a unknown file.
      You must to unlock the macros on the file:
           Right click on the file -> properties -> at the bottom of the general window click on the unlock box to tick it -> aplicate and accept.
          
      Use the buttons to change the parameters of the spirals and enjoy it.
.      
.      
  - The Pyton file:    ISG v1.0.py
      You need to install some libraries. For example the pygame module.
          Open a comand window (for example: Hotkey Windows+R and write cmd) and write the next code:  pip install pygame
          You also must have the math, sys, random and numpy libraries but someone are preinstalled on python.
          
      To use the program:
          - The space key pause and resume the program.
          - The exit key exits the program.
          * The program screen size is full screen but at depend on your screen the geometry may not draw on the center of the screen.

.  
  - The Executable file:    ISG v1.0.exe
      Just execute the file.
          * The program screen size is full screen but at depend on your screen the geometry may not draw on the center of the screen.
