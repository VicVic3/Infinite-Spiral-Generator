  Welcome to my program to create infinite spirals and weird geometries.<br>
  There are three files which basically make the same; an excel (.xlsm), an python file (.py) and an executable (.exe)<br>
<br>
  + The Exel file:    ISG v1.0 in Excel with macros.xlsm<br>
  	By default, Windows blocks the use of macros because is a unknown file.<br>
	You must to unlock the macros on the file:<br>
	    Right click on the file -> properties -> at the bottom of the general window click on the unlock box to tick it -> aplicate and accept.<br> 
        Use the buttons to change the parameters of the spirals and enjoy it.<br>
<br> 
  + The Pyton file:    ISG v1.0.py<br>
        You need to install some libraries. For example the pygame module.<br>
            Open a comand window (for example: Hotkey Windows+R and write cmd) and write the next code:  pip install pygame<br>
        You also must have the math, sys, random and numpy libraries but someone are preinstalled on python.<br>          
        To use the program:<br>
           - The space key pause and resume the program.<br>
           - The exit key exits the program.<br>
           * The program screen size is full screen but at depend on your screen the geometry may not draw on the center of the screen.<br>
<br>
  + The Executable file:    ISG v1.0.exe<br>
        Just execute the file.<br>
        * The program screen size is full screen but at depend on your screen the geometry may not draw on the center of the screen.<br>
